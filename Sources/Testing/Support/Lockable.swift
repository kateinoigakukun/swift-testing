/// A protocol describing a type that can be locked.

/// Lockable types are assumed to be address-sensitive, so all of this
/// protocol's requirements are static and take pointers to instances of `Self`
/// instead of being instance members.
///
/// To use a type conforming to this protocol, use ``Locked`` or
/// ``CustomLocked``.
///
/// This type is not part of the public interface of the testing library.

  ///   - address: The address at which to initialize the new instance. On call,
  ///     this pointer's memory is uninitialized.

  ///   - address: The address at which to deinitialize an existing instance.

  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - address: The address of the lock to acquire.
  ///   - body: A closure to invoke while the lock is held.

  /// - Returns: Whatever is returned by `body`.

  /// - Throws: Whatever is thrown by `body`.
